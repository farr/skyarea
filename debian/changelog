skyarea (0.3.0-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * This release removes several infrequently used command line arguments
    and secondary output data products: 2-step area estimation,
    injection finding, and plotting. This reflects a shift in emphasis
    from calculating accurate areas to calculating accurate sky maps.

  * Generate sky maps using a hybrid of the 2D and 3D KDEs. The 2D KDE has
    always produced smaller searched areas than the 3D KDE.

  * Restructure the class hierarchy to speed up with Python multiprocessing.

  * Add organization, command line, and version to FITS header.
