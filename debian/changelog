skyarea (0.3.2-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * This release is identical to 0.3.1, except that the RPM and Debian
    changelogs (which are embedded in the source tarball) have been updated.

  * Bring back the --seed option and make sure that it works correctly with
    multiprocessing.

  * Output sky maps in standard, fixed-resolution HEALPix format rather
    than the more esoteric multi-resolution format.

skyarea (0.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * This release removes several infrequently used command line arguments
    and secondary output data products: 2-step area estimation,
    injection finding, and plotting. This reflects a shift in emphasis
    from calculating accurate areas to calculating accurate sky maps.

  * Generate sky maps using a hybrid of the 2D and 3D KDEs. The 2D KDE has
    always produced smaller searched areas than the 3D KDE.

  * Restructure the class hierarchy to speed up with Python multiprocessing.

  * Add organization, command line, and version to FITS header.

skyarea (0.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium
